2.3
--------------------
First we have set epsilon fixed to 0.01 and gradually decrease M from 8 to 2, and we have seen
that classification rate has decreased as well. With parameters M = 8 and epsilon = 0.01, we
were able to achieve a constant perfect score with all 15 correct. As M becomes 2 we observed
that only 12 - 14 were able to be classified correctly and it's somewhat less stable than M = 8.

In terms of eplison, we found it somewhat less relevant to the classification rate. As we set
M = 8, most of the cases we can still achieve a perfect score. But it wasn's completely irrelevant,
as we increase the value of eplison, the results we get become less stable compare to a smaller
epsilon.

When we remove all irrelevant 15 speakers as we calculate the classification rate, we obeserved a
better result as we set M = 2 and eplilon = 0.9, we saw that the results are constantly ranges from
13 to 15 with 14 and 15 much more than 13, this suggests that by reducing the number of irrelevant
speakers to search for, it helps to increase the classification rate.



3.1
-------------------
With all parameters as default when training the HMM(M = 8, Q = 3, D = 14 and all training data),
we have observed an accuracy of 40.97%(449 correct out of 1096 phonemes).
